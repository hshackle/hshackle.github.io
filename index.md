I am a Pappalardo Fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), interested in a broad range of quantum many-body phenomena including quantum criticality, topological order, and open quantum systems.
I received my PhD in physics from Harvard University, advised by <a href=http://sachdev.physics.harvard.edu>Subir Sachdev</a>. Previously, I attended MIT as an undergraduate where I majored in both physics and philosophy.
