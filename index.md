@def tags = ["syntax", "code"]

I am a current PhD student in physics at Harvard University, advised by [Subir Sachdev](http://sachdev.physics.harvard.edu). I am interested in a broad range of quantum many-body phenomena, including quantum criticality, topological order, and open quantum systems. I attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate, where I majored in both physics and philosophy.
