# CV

My most up-to-date CV can be downloaded in pdf format [here](/pdfs/henryShackletonCV.pdf), and is also listed below. My Google Scholar page is linked [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VO6t9ZQAAAAJ&hl=en).

For most of my papers listed below, I also provide a link to a short summary of the project - these summaries are a bit technical and mainly intended as a brief explanation for people already familiar with the topic, as well as a way for me to record my most up-to-date perspective on the paper's results.
