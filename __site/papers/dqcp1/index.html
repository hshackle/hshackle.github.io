<div class="franklin-content"><p>This was the first of two papers studying phase transitions between gapless \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) spin liquids and ordered phases on the square lattice. This was motivated by a series of numerical studies of the \(J_1 - J_2\) model on the square lattice, which indicated the existence of a gapless \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) spin liquid in a narrow parameter window between Neel antiferromagnetism and valence bond solid &#40;VBS&#41; order. There has been strong numerical evidence over the years for some form of non-magnetic state existing in this parameter regime, but the precise nature of the phase or phases has not been definitively settled - in particular, there have been differing conclusions reached on whether excitations are gapped or gapless. </p>
<p>We construct a critical theory describing phase transitions between this spin liquid and the nearby Neel and VBS phases. With the inclusion of the square lattice symmetries, there exist a large number of spin liquids classified by the manner in which these symmetries are realized on the fractionalized excitations. In order to fully specify our critical theory, we assume a particular spin liquid arising from a fermionic parton construction, which goes by the name <em>Z2azz13</em> under Xiao-Gang Wen&#39;s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0107071">PSG classification</a>. This particular ansatz is used in variational wavefunction studies of the \(J_1 - J_2\) model and is found to have energies comparable to more unbiased studies, so we take this as our starting point. </p>
<p>Instabilities to Neel and VBS order are naturally captured by transitions into proximate spin liquid phases with larger gauge groups &#40;U&#40;1&#41;, SU&#40;2&#41;&#41;, which are then in turn unstable to these ordered phases through mechanisms like monopole proliferation and confinement. In particular, the \(\pi\)-flux phase, with an SU&#40;2&#41; gauge group, and a staggered flux phase with a U&#40;1&#41; gauge group, can both be accessed from the <em>Z2azz13</em> phase via Higgs transitions and both are unstable to Neel and VBS order. Consideration of the \(\pi\)-flux phase is especially natural due to its <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02426">dual description</a> as the noncompact \(\text{CP}^1\) model describing a direct Neel/VBS transition.</p>
<p>Leveraging the PSG classification of these symmetries, we can write down an effective field theory describing the transition between our \(\mathbb{Z}_2\) spin liquid and the proximate unstable spin liquid phases. The \(\mathbb{Z}_2 \rightarrow \text{SU}(2)\) transition is studied in this paper. A surprising feature about this critical theory, studied to leading-order in a \(N_f^{-1}\) expansion with \(N_f\) the number of fermions, is that it possesses a set of subsystem symmetries, arising from the projective representation of translational and rotational symmetries. Regulating the divergences arising from zero modes of this subsystem symmetry leads to UV/IR mixing and correlation functions which decay as \( e^{-\ln^2(r)}\) rather than power law. This is a rather striking prediction, although we emphasize that this behavior is found to leading-order in the \(N_f^{-1}\) expansion - the stability of this at finite \(N_f\), and validity of the large-\(N_f\) expansion more generally, is a direction for future work.</p>
