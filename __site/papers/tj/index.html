<div class="franklin-content"><p>Quantum phase transitions in strongly-correlated electronic systems induced by a critical level of doping are of great interest due to their conjectured relevance in describing the phase diagram of the cuprate superconductors, with an emphasis on the &quot;strange metal&quot; behavior observed near criticality. As a result, models that host such transitions and are either analytically or numerically tractable provide valuable insight into the nature of doping-induced criticality.</p>
<p>In this work, we numerically study a <em>t-J</em> model with random all-to-all spin exchanges and hopping. The disorder and all-to-all connectivity permits the use of extended dynamical mean-field theory &#40;EDMFT&#41; as an exact tool for calculating disorder-averaged observables. This is the approach used in a companion paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08607">here</a>, which finds a doping-induced transition between a spin glass at low doping and a Fermi liquid at high doping. However, these EDMFT studies cannot probe the spin glass phase directly, and moreover a low-temperature analysis is prohibited by the sign problem. We circumvent these issues by analyzing the all-to-all <em>t-J</em> model directly using exact diagonalization &#40;ED&#41;. </p>
<p>Our analysis confirms prior EDMFT predictions of a spin glass to Fermi liquid transition at a critical doping \(p_c \approx 1/3 \), signaled by both a vanishing of spin glass order as well as a maximum in entropy and charge susceptibility. An especially insightful quantity is the spin spectral function, plotted below for a range of dopings:</p>

<p>The low frequency peak is indicative of spin glass order, from which one can extract the Edwards-Anderson order parameter \(q\). This quantity vanishes around a critical doping \(p_c \approx 1/3 \). Remarkably, we observe that the background spectral weight is well-fit by the original spin liquid solution of a random all-to-all Heisenberg model, see Fig. 2 in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9212030">original paper</a> by Sachdev and Ye. This state was originally conjectured to give the ground state at zero doping - while numerical studies later confirmed the presence of spin glass order, we find that this spin liquid state still does an excellent job of describing the low-frequency behavior. Moreover, when the spin glass peak vanishes at \(p_c\), the spectral function closely resembles the SY solution, consistent with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08822">theoretical models</a> of this critical point.</p>
